# Challenge 7: Pewlett-Hackard Employee Database Analysis
Dan Nyhan 1st Attempt

## Purpose
The purpopse of this analysis is to determine the number of retiring employees per title, and identify employees who are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. We also wrote a report that helps prepare Bobby’s manager for the “silver tsunami” as many current employees reach retirement age.

In Devlierable 1, we have created a Retirement Titles table that holds all the titles of employees who were born between January 1, 1952 and December 31, 1955. Some employees may have multiple titles in the database—for example, due to promotions, so we created a table that contains the most recent title of each employee. We also created a table that has the number of retirement-age employees by most recent job title. Finally, because we want to include only current employees in our analysis, we excluded those employees who have already left the company.

In Deliverable 2, we referenced the ERD I created in the ETL module to create a mentorship-eligibility table that holds the current employees who were born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965.
